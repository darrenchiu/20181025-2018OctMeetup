This directory stores the materials in Dr. Howard Cheung's presentation on _How can we know that a machine learning algorithm classifies and detects faults well?_. It contains several files:

* _PyData-Presentation-20181025-Howard-Cheung.ipynb_: _Jupyter_ Notebook showing the Python code. Can be viewed online by clicking at the file or be downloaded to run locally
* _train.csv_: the Titanic event data from [Kagglel](https://github.com/agconti/kaggle-titanic)
* _Howard-Presentation-v00.pdf_: Presentation slides for the event

## Running the files locally?

To run the files locally, you'd need _Jupyter_. _Jupyter_ can be installed via installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Installing both will allow you to run the _.ipynb_ locally if you have both _train.csv_ file with it.
